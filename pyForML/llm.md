# Building a Lightweight Language Model (LLM) on a Personal Device Without GPU: From Beginner to Expert

Creating a simple large language model (LLM) from scratch to run on a personal device without a GPU is an exciting and challenging project. This curriculum guides you from the basics of deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) to deploying your own lightweight LLM, with mini-projects, code samples, and key concept explanations.

### Phase 1: Fundamentals of Python, Machine Learning, and NLP
**Goal**: Establish a strong understanding of Python, machine learning, and basic NLP.

#### 1. Python Basics
- **Topics**: Python syntax, functions, classes, file handling.
- **Libraries**: Key libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

**Mini-Project**: Build a Text Analyzer  
Write a Python script to count word frequency, extract unique words, and identify basic text patterns.

```python
from collections import Counter

def analyze_text(text):
    words = text.split()
    word_freq = Counter(words)
    unique_words = set(words)
    return word_freq, unique_words

sample_text = "OpenAI develops artificial intelligence."
print(analyze_text(sample_text))
```

#### 2. Intro to Machine Learning
- **Topics**: Supervised vs. unsupervised learning, training vs. test data, metrics like accuracy and loss.
- **Practice**: Use Scikit-Learn to build and evaluate simple models (e.g., logistic regression).

**Mini-Project**: Sentiment Classifier  
Use Scikit-Learn to classify text into positive and negative sentiments using a simple dataset.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

texts = ["I love this!", "I hate this!", "So good!", "So bad."]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1 for positive, 0 for negative

vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, labels, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Accuracy:", model.score(X_test, y_test))
```

### Phase 2: Deep Learning and Advanced NLP
**Goal**: Learn fundamental NLP tasks and get comfortable with PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning.

#### 1. Neural Networks and PyTorch Basics

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Sample data
input_size, hidden_size, num_classes = 10, 5, 2
model = SimpleNN(input_size, hidden_size, num_classes)
```

#### 2. Natural Language Processing Fundamentals
- **Topics**: Tokenization, embeddings, sentiment analysis, text generation.
- **Practice**: Use pre-trained word embeddings (Word2Vec or GloVe) for understanding word relationships.

**Mini-Project**: Implement Word Embeddings with GloVe  
Use GloVe embeddings in a text classifier to leverage pre-trained word vectors.

### Phase 3: Transformers and Basic Language Models
**Goal**: Understand and implement core concepts behind transformer-based models like GPT and BERT.

#### 1. Transformers and Attention Mechanism
- **Topics**: Self-attention, positional encoding, multi-head attention, transformer architecture.

**Mini-Project**: Implement a Transformer Block  
Implement a simple transformer block with PyTorch for better comprehension of the model's inner workings.

```python
import torch.nn.functional as F

class TransformerBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, emb_size, heads):
        super(TransformerBlock, self).__init__()
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=emb_size, num_heads=heads)
        self.feed_forward = nn.Linear(emb_size, emb_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x, _ = self.attention(x, x, x)
        x = F.relu(self.feed_forward(x))
        return x
```

#### 2. Training and Fine-tuning Small Language Models
- **Topics**: Use Hugging Face’s transformers library to load and fine-tune lightweight models on a small dataset.
- **Practice**: Fine-tune models like DistilBERT or GPT-2 on custom text datasets for specific tasks.

**Mini-Project**: Fine-tune DistilBERT for Text Classification  
Fine-tune DistilBERT on a sentiment dataset using Hugging Face’s Trainer API.

```python
from transformers import DistilBertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments

model = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="./results", per_device_train_batch_size=8, num_train_epochs=2)
trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=your_dataset)

trainer.train()
```

### Phase 4: Custom LLM Deployment on CPU
**Goal**: Build and deploy a lightweight language model that can run on a CPU.

#### 1. Building a Lightweight Model
- **Topics**: Use distillation techniques or simpler architectures (e.g., LSTM-based models) to create a smaller model.
- **Practice**: Train this model on a simplified language task (e.g., generating short responses).

**Mini-Project**: Create a Tiny LSTM-based Language Model  
Train a small LSTM model on text data to generate simple responses.

```python
class LSTMModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, emb_size, hidden_size, num_layers):
        super(LSTMModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, emb_size)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(emb_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.embedding(x)
        x, _ = self.lstm(x)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x
```

```

@app.get("/generate")
async def generate(text: str):
    result = nlp(text, max_length=50)
    return {"response": result[0]["generated_text"]}
```
